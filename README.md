Question 1: Data Preprocessing (Medium)

    a. Load the MNIST handwritten digit dataset and perform the following pre-processing steps:
    
    b. Normalize the pixel values of the images.
    
    c. Apply one-hot encoding to the target labels.
    
    d. Split the data into training, validation, and test sets.
    
    e. Dataset: https://github.com/iamavieira/handwritten-digits-mnist
    
    
Question 2: Classification (Hard)

    a. Build a logistic regression model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
    
    b. Evaluate the model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
    
    c. Fine-tune the model hyperparameters using grid search CV to improve performance.
    
    d. Visualize the decision boundary of the model.
